# Step Ahead - Revolutionizing Ed-Tech with Gamified Learning

This repository contains the codebase for **Step Ahead**, a platform developed during the 24-hour hackathon organized by **VedaVerse**. Step Ahead enhances the online learning experience by incorporating gamification techniques and social features to increase student engagement and retention.

## Project Overview

**Step Ahead** transforms traditional digital learning by turning education into an engaging, interactive, and rewarding process. By leveraging game mechanics, students remain motivated and actively participate in their learning journey.

## Features

### 1. Gamification Elements
Weâ€™ve integrated several key gamification features to ensure that learning feels interactive and enjoyable:
- **Daily Streaks:** Students are rewarded for consistent learning through streaks.
- **Leagues & Leaderboards:** Learners compete in Leagues based on their performance, motivating friendly competition and progress tracking.
- **Achievement Badges:** Unlock badges as you reach milestones and master various subjects.

### 2. Social Learning
To foster collaboration and support among students, Step Ahead introduces:
- **Global Chat:** A real-time chat for each course where students can:
  - Ask questions
  - Resolve doubts
  - Collaborate on projects
  - Share resources
  - Chill and network
- **Community Building:** By promoting communication, we aim to build a strong sense of community where students can help each other grow.

### 3. Seamless Learning Experience
Step Ahead is designed to ensure that the learning process is smooth and user-friendly:
- **Progress Tracking:** Students can easily track their progress, visualize their achievements, and set learning goals.
